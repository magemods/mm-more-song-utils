# More Song Utilities

This mod provides *more* ocarina-related quality of life features.

## Features
### Enable Sun's Song

Sure you have Song of Double Time, but this is more fun! Play it and watch NPCs zip around as time advances.

### Enable Saria's Song

Instead of communicating with Saria, this will start playing the Final Hours theme. Maybe there's a reason the developers disabled it, or *maybe* Saria is actually trying to tell you something...

### Auto Spawn Scarecrow

Forgot to set Scarecrow's song, or just too lazy to play it? Automatically spawn Pierre as soon as you start playing the ocarina.

### Persist Scarecrow's Song
![](https://github.com/magemods/mm-more-song-utils/blob/main/thunderstore_package/images/scarecrow-persist.jpg?raw=true)

Persist your Scarecrow's Song across Song of Time resets. You will still have the option to set a new song per cycle.
